##Introduction

This is a Jupyter Notebook that looks at data from the UK Government regarding house prices and the percentage of young people living with their parents and the average house price.

The data is from the year 1996 to the year 2020.

Parts of the data were put into CSV files so that Pandas could read the data and create a dataframe.
